sparkleshare (0.4.0-2) experimental; urgency=low

  * [2ac5762] Depend on gnome-icon-theme.
    SparkleShare unconditionally uses GNOME icons and crashes when they are
    not available. (Closes: #650209)
  * [21c88c5] Fix syntax errors in d/copyright, thanks Lintian
  * [f19ee73] Remove BD on nautlius-python since it is currently broken in Debian.
    When #649910 is fixed we can look at enabling it again.

sparkleshare (0.2.5-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * [f320fef] Imported Upstream version 0.2.5
    + Reimplement notes to be less buggy and backend independent. Polish
      about dialog and event log html. Fix a bug where large collections of
      files weren't being synced when adding them at the same time. The
      event log now collapses huge change sets and squashes events together
      by day when they are on the same day and in the same folder.
  * [8f862d6] Require mono 2.10 and cli-common-dev 0.8.
    New upstream release uses some CLR 4.0 APIs and so we need to bump the
    BDs
